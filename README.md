Installation
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/ymistyy/moneymaker.git
cd moneymaker

2. Set Up Python Environment

Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Reddit API Credentials

    Create an application on Reddit's Developer Portal.
    Copy the client_id, client_secret, and user_agent provided by Reddit.
    Create a .env file in the project root and add:

REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent

Usage
1. Prepare Directories

Ensure you have these directories in the project root:

    clips/ for gameplay footage (.mp4 files)
    fonts/ for font files (e.g., arial.ttf)
    animations/ for images/animations (.png, .jpg, .gif)
    music/ for background music (.mp3, .wav)

2. Run the Script

python main.py

3. Select Content

    The script will prompt you to select a Reddit post and a gameplay clip.
    Optionally, choose background music or proceed without it.

4. Output

The generated video will be saved in the output/ directory as video{n}.mp4, where {n} is the video index.
